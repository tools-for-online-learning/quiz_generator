{"1_original": {"question": "Every morning, Rajeev spends an hour alone drawing a portrait from a photograph in the day\u2019s newspaper to improve his portraiture skills (skills drawing a portrait). Yet, despite a year of practice, his drawing skills do not seem to improved. Why might simply practicing a portrait a day not yield an improvement?", "a": "Rajeev is getting a lot of practice, but he should ask an art instructor each day for feedback on how well he drew the day\u2019s portrait", "b": "Rajeev is practicing different tasks every day, so his practice isn\u2019t deliberate. He should try and draw the same portrait every day", "c": "Rajeev is practicing for too short a time. He should practice for a longer period of time", "d": "Rajeev\u2019s practice sessions are always in the morning; he should try varying his practice schedule", "correct": "A", "feedback": "He is not doing deliberate practice. B/c there is no feedback provided."}, "1_retake": {"feedback": "He is not doing deliberate practice. B/c there is no feedback provided.", "C": "Reason could be because he didn't get corrective feedback.", "correct": "C", "A": "Even without deliberate practice, Rajeev could improve his skill by practice. If his skill doesn't improve at all, that is not a problem of deliberate practice, it's a problem that he didn't practice the same skill every day. He is not practicing a specific skill (draw the eye of the portrait). Although the lack of feedback is also important, it's more important to focus on the same practice)", "B": "The task of creating a portrait is a complex one and should be studied step by step rather than in full. Hence, Rajeev should identify what parts of the portrait are problematic and practice them regularly instead of drawing new full portrait every day.", "D": "lack of deliberate practice, to say, always practice a general and broad task set without pinpointing where exactly is not good."}, "2_original": {"question": "Dan wants to improve his golf game. Every day, he practices one golf stroke for an hour, and records his practice session on video. After his practice, he watches the recording, and plans on what changes to make the next day. Assume he has no other golf instruction. Is Dan engaged in deliberate practice? Why?", "a": "Yes, because he is practicing a specific skill with rich feedback", "b": "No, because he is not getting task feedback from an external agent", "c": "No, because he is not able to practice corrections immediately (he must wait till the next day)", "d": "Yes, because he is practicing a specific skill with knowledge of the results of his previous attempts", "correct": "B,C", "feedback": "The feedback needs to be given by an external agent"}, "2_retake": {"feedback": "The feedback needs to be given by an external agent", "B": "It is. Because it includes practice on a specific skill, supervised by himself, get feedback from himself, and remedial training the next day.", "correct": "B", "A": "Yes, he has isolated a specific task, practices it repeatedly and reviews his sessions to narrow on improvements.", "C": "no, because he needs an instructor to provide informative feedback", "D": "No, because deliberate practice requires that an external agent provide feedback to the learner."}, "3_original": {"question": "Mark is learning to play the guitar. After long hours of practice, he mastered playing his favorite song. Write one growth-mindset building feedback his instructor could give him.", "a": "You are a talented musician", "b": "Great persistent on your learning", "c": "Amazing job!", "d": "Well done keeping the right rhythm", "correct": "B,D", "feedback": "Great, you are doing well on this song because of your hard practice. You could do better on other songs and more complex skills if you continue to practice like this."}, "3_retake": {"feedback": "Great, you are doing well on this song because of your hard practice. You could do better on other songs and more complex skills if you continue to practice like this.", "B": "Good job on practicing the right skill!", "correct": "B", "A": "Remind him of long term goals, and the growth that is still possible and how his current achievement reflects that. Basically tell him how great he's done and tell him he's going to continue to better in the future.", "C": "One of the most important things about growth mindset is giving feedback on the task that Mark is doing and not on his own personality of him being a talented musician. One growth mindset instruction his instructor could give him is \"Great work in your performance today. Keep up with your perseverance.\"", "D": "You did a great job putting efforts into practice and it paid off!"}, "4_original": {"question": "Many teachers who have used Jigsaw report that students start to see themselves in a different light -- as more competent, likable, and positive contributors to the classroom. Does the Jigsaw method create a growth-intelligence mindset?", "a": "Yes, because it shows students that they can grow in their abilities", "b": "Yes, because it shows students that other students in their group can grow in their abilities", "c": "No, because it doesn\u2019t implicate how the brain works, and the malleable nature of intelligence", "d": "No, because while it shows students that they can grow abilities in one subject, it leaves them uncertain about whether they can grow abilities in other subjects", "correct": "C", "feedback": "Jigsaw is about collaborative learning and empathy, but not actually about growth mindset."}, "4_retake": {"feedback": "Jigsaw is about collaborative learning and empathy, but not actually about growth mindset.", "A": "No, because it doesn\u2019t implicate how the brain works, and the malleable nature of intelligence. Jigsaw doesn't help students or teachers discover why it works, It doesn't help intelligence either.", "correct": "A", "B": "Yes, because it gives them the confidence that they can master a concept enough to teach others and help others do well when tested on that concept.", "C": "Yes, students are encouraged to learn , express, they are seeing others rely on themselves and see themselves improve.", "D": "According to the reading, Carlos changed his mindset because his groupmates think he was someone they could work with and someone they could appreciate."}}
